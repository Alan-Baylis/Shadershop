Architecture
  Move "builtIn" into its own file.
  Move "combiners" into their own thing. Think of better name.


Misc
  Figure out how React context works
  Do something better than util.safeInv
  Tune mousewheel zooming
  Delete key
  Undo
  Duplicate
  Check that you don't create dependency loops
  Need to listen for scroll events on Scrollers and refresh





Plot
  Plot wants to be configurable: at least which axes correspond to which coordinates in domain/range





Outline Stuff
  Break out "Inspector"
  Create definition button / right click item - create by abstracting
  Thumbnails
  Show transform numbers when they're not identity?


Inspector
  Highlight transform numbers when hovering the control point
  Show transform numbers next to control point
  Scrub transform numbers in inspector?


Palette
  Insert button
  Anything can be dragged into the outline to put it in a specific place
  Maybe
    + insert buttons in outline like before
    select multiple and then click "add", "multiply", etc. to group those






Get Grid using better Plot API

Get ShaderOverlayView using better Plot API
  Be able to use any coordinates (right now d0, r0 is hardcoded for cartesian, and d0, d1, r0 is hardcoded for colorMap)


Button to switch between cartesian and colorMap plots in MainPlotView
  For colorMap, only draw the main plot
  Try out better color scale for colorMap

Instead of a @scale property in Plot, just have pixelSize. Make UI.thumbnailScale for the thumbnails.
