Plot
  Tune mousewheel scrolling

Architecture
  Move "builtIn" into its own file.
  Move "combiners" into their own thing. Think of better name.





Wishlist
  Hide and show children



Misc
  Figure out how React context works
  Profile and redo so we don't have to relayout all the time




selectedChildFn -> selectedPath


Do appropriate nested transformation of child fns on main plot


Transform numbers shouldn't show when they're the default value
Highlight transform numbers when hovering the control point

Do something better than util.safeInv




We want control points on the plot
  Plot wants to be configurable: at least which axes correspond to which coordinates in domain/range





Outline Stuff
  Break out "Inspector"
  Thumbnails
