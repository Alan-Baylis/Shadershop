Outline View
  Display references better
  Reorder references (for composition)
  Think about richer outline

Definitions
  Drag (rather than click) to add
  Click to select definition

Plot
  Tune mousewheel scrolling

Architecture
  Move "builtIn" into its own file.
  Move "combiners" into their own thing. Think of better name.





Wishlist
  Hide and show children



Misc
  Figure out how React context works
  Profile and redo so we don't have to relayout all the time




selectedChildFn -> selectedPath


Show "visible" fns on the main plot
  Do appropriate transformation
Select child fns from the outline


Transform numbers shouldn't show when they're the default value
Highlight transform numbers when hovering the control point
