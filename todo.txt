Plot
  Tune mousewheel scrolling

Architecture
  Move "builtIn" into its own file.
  Move "combiners" into their own thing. Think of better name.





Wishlist
  Hide and show children



Misc
  Figure out how React context works
  Profile and redo so we don't have to relayout all the time




selectedChildFn -> selectedPath


Show "visible" fns on the main plot
  Do appropriate transformation
Select child fns from the outline


Transform numbers shouldn't show when they're the default value
Highlight transform numbers when hovering the control point





zIndex should be variables in style
colors for cartesian plots should be in config (and remove canvas styles)














vectors stored as array
matrices stored as array of arrays in row major order (as in numeric.js)


Adding dimensionality
  childFn
    getDomainTranslate -> [..4..]
    getDomainTransform -> [[..4..]]
    getRangeTranslate  -> [..4..]
    getRangeTransform  -> [[..4..]]







getDomainTranslate
  [@domainTranslate.getValue(), 0, 0, 0]

getDomainTransform
  [[@domainScale.getValue(),0,0,0], [0,1,0,0], [0,0,1,0], [0,0,0,1]]




((v - domainTranslate) * domainTransformInv)
expr
(v * rangeTransform + rangeTranslate)
