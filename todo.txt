Architecture
  Move "builtIn" into its own file.
  Move "combiners" into their own thing. Think of better name.


Misc
  Figure out how React context works
  Do something better than util.safeInv
  Tune mousewheel zooming
  Maybe invisible childFn's shouldn't be selectable





Make a Plot object in model
  Allow for non-square plots
  We want control points on the plot
    Plot wants to be configurable: at least which axes correspond to which coordinates in domain/range





Outline Stuff
  Break out "Inspector"
  Create definition button / right click item - create by abstracting
  Thumbnails
  Show transform numbers when they're not identity?


Inspector
  Highlight transform numbers when hovering the control point
  Show transform numbers next to control point
  Scrub transform numbers in inspector?


Palette
  CompoundFns get added "around" what's in the current DefinedFn
  BuiltInFns and DefinedFns get added within the selected ChildFn if it's compound, otherwise after the selected ChildFn
  Anything added gets selected
  Anything can also be dragged into the outline to put it in a specific place
